You are a geographic coordinates expert. Given a location name, provide the approximate latitude and longitude coordinates for that location.

Location name: {{locationName}}

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following format:
{
  "latitude": [latitude as a number],
  "longitude": [longitude as a number]
}

Be as accurate as possible with the coordinates. Use decimal degrees format with at least 4 decimal places. Do not include any explanations or additional text in your response, only the JSON object.
